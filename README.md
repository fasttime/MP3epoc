MP3epoc is a command line tool to view or modify unused information, also referred to as
attributes, in the frame headers of MP3 files, including the private, copyright and original home
bits and the emphasis field.

While most audio players simply ignore this information (Winamp just displays copyright, original
and emphasis attributes in the MP3 file info box), real MP3 maniacs do not!
Actually, the reason why I wrote MP3epoc is I couldn't find any free software with its capabilities
(still wondering why there are so many apps for tagging MP3's instead).

MP3epoc is available in English, German and Italian.

The C++ source code is for MP3epoc for Windows and MP3epoc for OS X.
The C# code is for the .NET Framework / Mono multiplatform version.
